"Tigase MUC component has undergone a few major changes to our code and "

"We decided to improve performance of MUC repository storage and to do so "
"we needed to change database schema of MUC component. Additionally we "
"decided to no longer use *in-code* database upgrade to update database "
"schema of MUC component and rather provide separate schema files for "
"every supported database."
msgstr ""

#: ../../Announcement.rst:14
msgid ""
"To continue usage of new versions of MUC component it is required to "
"manually load new component database schema, see :ref:`Preparation of "
"database<Preparation_of_database>` section for informations about that."

"Moreover we no longer store rooms list and configurations inside "
"``UserRepository`` of default Tigase XMPP Server database. Instead we use"
" separate tables which are part of new schema. Due to that it is required"
" to execute converter which will move room configurations from "
"``UserRepository`` to new tables. It needs to be executed **AFTER** new "
"database schema is loaded to database."

#: ../../Announcement.rst:20
msgid ""
"If you used separate database to store messages history we strongly "
"suggest to use same database for new schema and storage of rooms "
"configurations as well. In other case message history will not be moved "
"to new schema."

"In this version we added support for `XEP-0313: Message Archive "
"Management <http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html:>`__ protocol which "

msgid ""
"In this version we disabled by default support for `XEP-0091: Legacy "
"Delayed Delivery <https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0091.html:>`__. This "
"decision was made due to the fact that usage of XEP-0091 is not "
"recommended any more and should be used only for backward compatibility. "
"Moreover, it added overhead to each transmitted message sent from MUC "
"room history, while the same information was already available in "
"`XEP-0203: Delayed Delivery "
"<https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0203.html:>`__ format. For more "
